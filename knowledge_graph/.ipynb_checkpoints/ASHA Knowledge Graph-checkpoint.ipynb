    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "You are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\n",
    "- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts. They're akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n",
    "- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it accessible for a vast audience.\n",
    "## 2. Labeling Nodes\n",
    "- **Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n",
    "  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **\"person\"**. Avoid using more specific terms like \"mathematician\" or \"scientist\".\n",
    "- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n",
    "{'- **Allowed Node Labels:**' + \", \".join(allowed_nodes) if allowed_nodes else \"\"}\n",
    "{'- **Allowed Relationship Types**:' + \", \".join(allowed_rels) if allowed_rels else \"\"}\n",
    "## 3. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n",
    "- Numerical data, like age or other related information, should be incorporated as attributes or properties of the respective nodes.\n",
    "- **No Separate Nodes for Dates/Numbers**: Do not create separate nodes for dates or numerical values. Always attach them as attributes or properties of nodes.\n",
    "- **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n",
    "- **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n",
    "- **Naming Convention**: Use camelCase for property keys, e.g., `birthDate`.\n",
    "## 4. Coreference Resolution\n",
    "- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\n",
    "If an entity, such as \"John Doe\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \"Joe\", \"he\"),\n",
    "always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \"John Doe\" as the entity ID.\n",
    "Remember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n",
    "## 5. Strict Compliance\n",
    "Adhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\n",

You have been selected by your community \\nto serve as a resource because you understand their needs, their beliefs and \\npractices, the social factors, where the poor and needy live, and what people \\nwant from health services. You already know a lot about the community in which you live. However in order to be an effective resource, you need \\nadditional knowledge and skills. You need to learn about health rights and \\nentitlements, the causes and treatment of common illnesses, and type of treatment available at different facilities. You need to develop the skills to \\ncommunicate health related information to people in the community, to \\ncounsel them on prevention of illness and to adopt healthy behaviours, to treat minor ailments and the leadership ability to help people negotiate access to \\nrights and entitlements. \\nThis book is the first in a series of books that will help you do this. As a new \\nentrant to the ASHA programme, this book provides you with a basic level of \\nknowledge and skills to enable you to start your work. After you have grasped \\nthe contents of this book and have applied your new knowledge in your community, additional rounds of trainings will follow, in which you will not only \\nlearn many new things but also get more information on topics that you will \\nlearn in this book. Your community is also an important source of knowledge. Use the knowledge and skills that you get from your books, to build on your \\nlearning from the community, so that you can offer help to the people. That \\nis why your training is conducted for a short duration and allows you time to practice your new skills in the community. After this training, you will be \\nassessed and get a basic certification in communication and social mobilisation. \\nThe next level of certification is after four rounds of training and this will enable you to address issues in care of mothers, newborns and children. As your skill \\nlevel improves, additional certification will be available.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'asha.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='Induction Training Module for ASHAs\\n 8Activities of an ASHA \\nASHA’s work consists mainly of five activities:\\n1. Home visits: For two to three hours every day, for at least four or five days \\na week, you should visit the families living in your community. If it is a large \\nvillage, then you will have a certain number of allocated households. Home visits are mainly for health promotion and preventive care. Over time, \\nfamilies will come to you when there is a problem and you will not have to \\ngo so often to their houses. However, where there is a child below two years of age or any malnourished child or a pregnant woman, you should visit the families at home for counselling them. Also, if there is a newborn in the \\nhouse, a series of seven visits or more becomes essential.\\n2. Attending the Village Health and Nutrition Day (VHND): On one day every month, when the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) comes to provide \\nantenatal care, immunisation and other services in the village, you, as the ASHA will promote attendance by those who need the Anganwadi or ANM \\nservices and help with service delivery.\\n3.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'asha.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='11 Induction Training Module for ASHAsValues of an ASHA\\nHere are some important values which should guide you in your work: \\nBe kind:  Have compassion for people and never be afraid to show that you \\ncare. Be especially kind to those who are sick, it is more important than a \\nmedicine. Try not to refuse your services to any individual who really needs them. \\nTreat everybody equally:  Treat each individual equally irrespective of her or \\nhis class, caste, sex and religion. As a health worker your concern is well being of \\nall the individuals not just those you know well or who come to you or who are \\nthe better off and powerful. Inequalities in our society deprive many sections \\nof community from health care services. These are the marginalised people and include those who come from extremely poor families, live in inaccessible or \\ndistant part of our villages, belong to scheduled caste/scheduled tribe families, \\nhave only women in their households and are disabled or handicapped. Treating everybody equally also means spending more time and effort on those \\nwhose needs are more.\\nBe responsible: Be responsible to your designated duties and never misuse \\nyour authority for your benefit or for the benefit of friends and relatives \\nRespect people’s traditions and ideas:  People are slow to change their \\nattitudes and traditions and are true to what they feel is right. Rather than \\ninsisting that they adopt your approach, you must try to build on their existing \\nknowledge with your ideas. For example-you can promote the use of modern \\nmedicine together with the traditional methods and the combination may serve better than either one alone. Thus, you can promote the use of ORS for \\ntreating a child with diarrhoea but at the same time encourage mothers to use \\ntraditional preparation like rice water, coconut water to overcome dehydration.\\nKeep learning: Use every chance you get to increase your own knowledge \\neither through reading books, or attending training programmes or asking \\nquestions. \\nBe a role model:  If you want people to take part in improving their village and \\ncare for their health, you must be a role model and practise healthy habits and \\nbehaviours. This way you will earn people’s trust and confidence.'),\n",

Clean living environment and proper hygienic conditions ensure \\ngood health. The place we live, the food we eat, our drinking water and \\nthe air we breathe - needs to be free of pollutants, harmful chemicals and disease causing germs. This will prevent spread of many illnesses \\nlike respiratory infections, diarrhoea, breathing problems etc. \\nSocio cultural factors\\nBoth social and economic inequality and deprivation have an \\nadverse effect on health. Thus poorer households, families from more \\nmarginalised communities with poor education and those in more \\nhealth risk prone occupations are more likely to have malnutrition, illness and deaths. Social beliefs and cultural practices also have a \\nstrong link with the health of an individual. For example, Neglect of \\ngirl child leads to compromised health status of women.\\nLife style\\nLife style consists of health behaviours and practices that affect the health of individuals. Lifestyles that have a positive influence are \\nregular exercise, a nutritious well balanced diet, etc. Some forms of life \\nstyles may be detrimental to health. These are: Alcohol/drug abuse/tobacco chewing/smoking etc. \\nGenetic factors (Heredity)\\nGenetic make-up is what we inherit from our parents. It plays a role in determining our physical structure, appearance (body-frame, height, \\nweight, looks, colour of our skin) and also some mental and emotional \\ntraits of our personality. It is important for you to know that some diseases are also linked to hereditary factors. They include high blood \\nsugar, high blood pressure etc. \\nAvailability of and access to appropriate health services\\nFor individuals to remain healthy it is important that health services \\nare available, accessible and affordable. As a community health worker \\nyour role is not only to promote healthy life practices but also in \\nfacilitating and organising community’s access to health services and treatment for illnesses.There are several levels at which health services \\nare provided by the health system and you will learn about this later \\nin the module.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'asha.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='Induction Training Module for ASHAs\\n 30For participatory leadership you need to\\nl Establish goals and set the direction: First articulate an achievable goal for \\nyour village. Involve your community through local institutions especially the \\nvillage health sanitation and nutrition committee on how, where and when \\nit would be completed. For example, all children of your village should be immunised in the next six months. \\nl Set high standards and high expectations: Be firm \\nabout ensuring high quality health care services from \\nthe sub-centre and the PHC for your village community. \\nEg. Make sure that the ANM reaches the village on the designated VHND, with the requisite equipment \\nand drugs (weighing scales, BP apparatus, disposable \\nsyringes for immunisation, ice box for vaccines) and drugs and provides the package of services for \\nmothers and children. If the health service provider treats a community member with disrespect or does not provide the services or does not pay \\nattention to quality, you should feel able to ask her to change behaviour or \\npractice.\\nl Be accountable and responsible: to the community and the health care provider by being an effective link and sharing information. But being \\nconstantly critical of the situation will have no positive outcome. Address the \\nissue by sharing your grievances with authorities who can take action. For example, if the ANM is not coming to your village regularly or she is not visiting \\nthe houses of socially backward families, have the courage to tell her that you \\nhave noted her absence and you will take the necessary steps if this continues. Enlist the help of VHSNC, Sarpanch, Block Medical Health Officer or Chief \\nMedical Health Officer and ensure that the ANM visits your village regularly.\\nl Involve others in decision-making: Do not make any decisions alone. A \\ndecision, which affects the community, needs to be taken along with the community members, with their complete ownership. For example, better \\nresults are attained if priorities and decisions regarding community health needs are taken as part of collectives such as the VHSNC. \\nl Motivate others: By involving the Panchayat, SHG members and VHSNC \\nthrough regular contact, sharing necessary information, giving them \\nresponsibility and acknowledging their support and efforts in public. \\nInvite the community to join you in availing of their right to quality health care. Involve community members in the process when availing for them \\ntheir entitlements from the public health system or by giving them some \\nresponsibility to improve the health status of the community.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'asha.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='31 Induction Training Module for ASHAsl Achieve unity: As a leader you need to promote unity among your \\ncommunity members and between the community members and health \\ncare providers. Unity comes when community members feel the ownership \\nfor their health and see that they also have a role in achieving the goal.\\nl Serve as a role models: Always set an example that can be followed. For \\nexample, you are assigned the role of accompanying a pregnant woman \\nfor a referral. If you performed this role and saved the life of woman in your \\nvillage, you have set an example. Next time, when the need arises, other community members will come forward to accompany a pregnant woman \\nduring an emergency. They may also arrange for money and transport, if \\nrequired. You should constantly improve your knowledge and skills and try to \\nbe aware of any new developments regarding the health services and new \\nschemes declared primarily by being in touch with the ANM. Improve your \\nskills by practising them.\\nl Represent the community: Make sure you represent the entire community \\n(including the marginalised sections) while discussing their health concerns \\nwith the health service provider. For example, you have to develop a comprehensive village health plan along with the Panchayat and VHSNC. While developing a plan you need to share the concerns of the poorest of \\nthe poor of your community. If some segment of the community has shared \\nthat the source of drinking water is not accessible to them, it should become a point of discussion while developing a comprehensive health plan for the \\nvillage. \\nCommunication Skills\\nCommunication is the exchange or \\ntwo-way flow of information and ideas \\nbetween two or more persons.

One-way communication is when only you talk \\nand the other has not understood. This is incomplete and ineffective.\\nEffective Verbal Communication has Accuracy;  \\nClarity and Correctness. \\nl Non-Verbal Communication: We all know that communication is not only \\nabout words and languages. Silence also communicates, and there are \\ngestures that people make with their hands, body and eyes. These forms \\nof communication are referred to as non-verbal communication. Here are some non-verbal forms of communication:\\nl Eye contact: with the person to whom you are talking will indicate your sincerity and confidence. \\nl Body posture: Facing the person, standing or sitting appropriately close and holding your head erect gives value or weight to your messages\\nl Facial expressions: Effective communication requires supporting facial expressions therefore express appropriate feelings on your face\\nl Gestures: Use of hand gestures to describe and emphasise adds value but it should not be overdone in excitement or anxiety. \\nl Written Communication: As an ASHA you will need to write applications and letters to the authorities to improve access to health care services. You \\nalso need to document the processes and decisions taken during meetings. \\nYou will thus have to learn to write simply and effectively. (In Annexure 6, \\nthere is an exercise for you on writing). Even if you take the help of others in \\nthe community, you should remember the following important points: \\nl Address it to the appropriate person \\nl Check that the letter has a date and topic \\nl Keep sentences short and avoid unnecessary words\\nl Use simple and familiar words instead of complex and unfamiliar ones \\nl Explain facts through evidence and examples \\nActive listening is also part of communication\\nHearing and listening are not the same.

This type of listening takes the same \\namount of, or more, energy than speaking. It requires the listener to hear various \\nmessages, understand the meaning and then verify the meaning by offering feedback, or confirming by paraphrasing what was heard. \\nFor good listening: Encourage individuals to talk by using positive gestures \\nand words, remove distractions and try to understand non-verbal signals.

This will help you understand the other person’s point of \\nview. In case of talking to your beneficiary check if she has any question and \\nanswer in simple language\\nl Acknowledge the efforts made by the beneficiaries and never forget to \\ncompliment/appreciate them.\\nNote: In health communication, while counselling individuals you need to actively listen to what is being said, analyse all the factors and then dialogue with the person so that, together, the right choices are made. Counselling involves problem \\nsolving and not merely preaching to adopt correct practices. \\nDecision Making Skills\\nEach decision has a consequence and even a small \\ndecision can change many things. All of us can recall \\nsome such decisions taken personally or by others \\nwhich have left an important impact. As an ASHA you will be often required to take decisions, that will affect \\nthe community at large. Hence, you should learn the \\nskill of participatory decision-making by involving the community at all levels. \\nSome basic steps of decision-making are: \\nl Define the Problem: Examine the situation carefully \\nand analyse it from all perspectives to find out the \\nactual problem. \\nl Gather Information and share with the community: As a next step collect \\nall the necessary information, seek advice from the appropriate authority and involve the community. Take information on what exists, what does not \\nexists and what needs to be there. At this stage of decision-making you need to arrange a community meeting and discuss the situation to help them \\nbecome part of the solution. \\nl Think of possible solutions: You should work with the VHSNC and even the \\nGram Sabha if needed on identifying solutions. At this stage many solutions will be offered. It shows that people accept and understand the problem, and \\nare interested in identifying solutions.\\nl Choose one solution by consensus: Part of effective decision-making is \\nthe ability to select one alternative from the various options available. This \\ncan be done through consensus of the community and approval of the \\nauthorities. To gain consensus and approval you need to discuss this in the VHSNC meetings and the Gram Sabha. Before selecting the right alternative, \\nassess all available options.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'asha.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='35 Induction Training Module for ASHAsl Put the Decisions to Work: An effective decision is one which can be put \\ninto action. Thus, implementation is very important. During this process, \\nkeep checking if it is moving towards the expected solution, and if there is \\nsomething else which needs to be addressed. An effective decision should not leave any unhappy feeling \\namong group members after the meeting \\nhas been a djourned. It does not set up conflict of a debilitating nature \\namong persons or groups.\\nDecision-making skills are sharpened through experience and practice. But one needs to be confident and prepared to take responsibility if the decision fails. \\nHow to handle difficult situations\\nIf you are finding it difficult to take a decision, take a short break and then continue. After the break ask the group member/s to restate the issue and \\nreview the options. It may be a good idea to adjourn and let people think about \\nit overnight. \\nNegotiation Skills\\nNegotiating is the process by which two or more people/parties with different needs and goals work to find a mutually acceptable solution to an issue. As \\nan ASHA you will have to deal with differences. You have to resolve these \\ndifferences to achieve the larger goals of village health programmes. You will have to constantly negotiate with people and situations in order to be able to \\nfulfil your responsibility. It is important to realise that it is quite a challenge to \\nnegotiate with people in authority but with enough preparation and practice you can deal effectively with any kind of situation which requires negotiation. \\nThe steps of Successful Negotiation\\nl Ask for the other person’s perspective: In a negotiating situation use \\nquestions to find out what the other person’s concerns and needs might be. \\nSome examples of likely questions are: What do you need from me on this? \\nWhat are your concerns about what I am suggesting/asking? When you hear \\nthe other person express their needs or concerns, use appropriate listening \\nresponses to make sure you heard correctly. \\nl State Y our needs: In the process of negotiation the other person requires to know your needs. It is very important to state not only what you need but \\nalso why you need it. \\nl Prepare options beforehand: Before entering into a negotiation, prepare \\nsome options that you can suggest if your preferred solution is not \\nacceptable. Anticipate why the other person may resist your suggestion and \\nbe prepared to counter the same with an alternative.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'asha.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='Induction Training Module for ASHAs\\n 36l Do not argue: Negotiating is about arriving at solutions. Arguing is about \\ntrying to prove the other person wrong. We know that during negotiation \\nwhen each party tries to prove the other one wrong, no progress is made. \\nIf you disagree with something state your disagreement in a gentle, but assertive, way. Do not demean the other person or get into a power struggle. \\nl Consider timing: There are good times to negotiate and bad times. Bad times include those situations where there is a high degree of anger on \\neither side, a preoccupation with something else, a high level of stress or \\ntiredness on one side or the other. \\nSuggestions for effective negotiation \\nWhile negotiating as an ASHA you must be patient. Never try to make the opponent feel low and defeated. Empathise with the other person to \\nunderstand her/his perspective. Be positive and open in your approach. Do not \\nbegin the discussion with any set assumptions or negative feelings. \\nApproach a negotiation with an attitude of,  “I accept you as an equal \\nnegotiating partner and respect your right to have an opinion of your own. “ \\nYou may think that this is being soft and not effective, but this approach is a sign of internal strength and confidence. \\nHow to use your negotiation skills effectively?\\nIn your community you may come across several issues that require to be \\naddressed. For example, VHND does not take place, the Anganwadi is not \\nfunctioning well; children and women are not receiving their entitlement of \\nsupplementary food; the midday meal provided is not adequate or cooked properly; widow pension is not being received despite completion of \\nformalities etc. \\nl To change such situations first try to find out if things can be changed \\nby drawing the attention of people like the Sarpanch, the ANM, the \\nschoolteacher, AWW through direct dialogue.\\nl If the situation still does not improve, try to organise people and facilitate \\ngroup discussions over the issue. The VHSNC meeting is a good forum to \\naddress such issues.\\nl If this also does not work, try to identify organisations working on the same \\nissue and seek their support. If you decide to initiate a movement alongwith \\nthe people to change a situation, organising people who are affected with the \\nsame issues is important and is essential for activism to be effective.'),\n",

Disease is often used \\nto refer to any condition that causes pain,  dysfunction,  distress,  or death to \\nthe person afflicted. It usually affects people not only physically, but also emotionally and psychologically, as diseases can alter one’s perspective on life and their personality.\\nDiseases can also be classified as communicable and non-communicable \\ndisease.\\nCommunicable diseases – These are diseases that spread from one person to \\nanother either directly or through a carrier such as a mosquito or flies. Some \\nexamples of such diseases are: Common colds, (directly) Diarrhoeal diseases (flies), Malaria (mosquitoes), and Tuberculosis (directly). Steps must be taken \\nto prevent their spread from the persons affected to other people in the \\ncommunity.\\nNon Communicable diseases – They are usually associated with people’s life \\nstyles (tobacco, alcohol, obesity), pollution, and deficiency or excess of some \\nnutrients. They never spread from one person to another. Some common examples are high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, stroke, and many other \\nillnesses. \\nIn our community we may notice some people living with various physical and \\nmental disabilities such as deafness, blindness etc. Physical and mental injuries \\ndue to accidents such as road accident/accidents which occur at work and \\nanimal bites also belong to this category. \\nHealing \\nOur body has its own defence, or way to resist diseases and heal itself. In most \\ncases, these natural defence mechanisms are more important to our health than medicines. \\nHave you seen how a tree heals its axe injury? First the gum fills the gap. The gum \\nhardens and gradually becomes wooden. A similar effect occurs in human body for many illnesses. \\nEven in a case of more serious illness, when a medicine is needed, it is the body \\nthat must overcome the disease; the medicine only helps.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'asha.pdf', 'page': 47}, page_content='47 Induction Training Module for ASHAs Our body has its own defence mechanism (immunity) which fights against \\ngerms or diseases causing organisms. This system matures as body learns how \\nto fight germs. This helps us recover from an illness. The severity and duration of \\nillness vary with the type of the pathogen and defence mechanism of the body to resist the infection.\\nNote – Components of mother’s breast milk enable baby to fight many illnesses. \\nThe first thick milk (colostrum) is a priceless shield for the baby and should never be discarded. \\nIn case of non- communicable diseases adopting an active and healthy life \\nstyle is the key to prevent, reverse or minimise the symptoms of the diseases. Medications and supplements may also provide help in reducing the effects of \\nsuch diseases. In some severe conditions surgeries may be required. \\nTreatment for Diseases\\nHealing with traditional medicines\\nThere are certain traditional ways of healing and treating illnesses. \\nThe traditional systems of medicines include Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, \\nSiddha and Homeopathy. There are also home remedies which are \\npassed on through generations. Many of these are of great value, cheaper and do not have harmful side effects as only natural herbs \\nand therapies are used in making them.

Some \\npatients insist on injections and saline bottles. Many doctors are also driven by profit \\nmotives. You should educate people that these are useful only in certain conditions. People can save expenses with help of simple remedies. The saline in the bottle is just water, salt \\nand some sugar. If we prepare it at home and take orally the effect is the same.\\nPreventing misuse of TonicsMany doctors prescribe these tonics, because patients ask for them. Tonics are not \\nnecessary for the growth of body or to give energy. They are just a combination of \\nwater, sugar, vitamins and some minerals. The cost is often very high. In most of the cases, for gaining strength and ensuring growth a simple nutritious home cooked meal \\nis enough.\\nAvoiding self-medicationPeople often buy medicines by themselves or use any medicines lying in the house for \\nconditions such as fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and headaches. This should not be \\ndone. Most drugs cause side effects, and some are harmful. The side effects of some of the commonly used medicines used in self-medication are:\\nl Drugs used as pain killers: Almost all painkillers cause irritation of stomach and many of these, when taken over long periods, can cause internal bleeding and \\nstomach ulcers.\\nl Anti-allergic drugs: Are used in the treatment of cold and cough and can cause \\nsleepiness, which can sometimes cause accidents.\\nl Antibiotics: Antibiotics might cause life-threatening ‘reactions’ if a person is allergic to them. Some antibiotics can disturb intestinal bacteria and induce diarrhoea.\\nMany drugs affect our vital organs, like the liver and the kidney as these organs flush out drugs and toxins from our body. Some people also treat children with the same medications which have been prescribed to adults. This is dangerous since children \\nneed much smaller doses. Doses are given according to the body weight. Most \\nimportantly, pregnant women should not take any medicine without consulting a qualified doctor, as these could harm the unborn baby. \\nTaking correct dose of medicines\\nBoth overdose and inadequate dosage can be harmful, especially in children.

Infected Wound\\n1. Care of the wounds with no bleeding\\nThese wounds include small abrasions, small cuts, scrapes and other small \\nwounds.  Prompt first aid can help nature heal small wounds and deal with \\ngerms. Bleeding is usually limited to oozing and is due to damage to minute \\nblood vessels. Even these types of wounds need to be attended immediately as they may get contaminated and become infected.\\nTake the following steps while managing these wounds:\\nl Wash your hands using soap and water\\nl Clean the wound, using pre boiled and cold water (Soap can be used if the \\nwound is contaminated with dirt. But remember excess soap may damage \\nthe flesh.) \\n Or, gently w ipe the dirt away using cotton without rubbing it. Rubbing \\ndisturbs the clot and restart bleeding, thus delaying the healing process. Use \\ndifferent cotton swabs each time.\\n* Certain parts of this section have been taken from the book Where There is no Doctor.'),\n",

A clean wound \\nwill heal without any medicine. Cleanliness is of first importance in preventing \\ninfection and helping wounds to heal. If a person gets a cut, scrape or wound,  \\nhe/she should be referred immediately to take Tetanus Toxoid injection.\\nFamily members should be warned to:\\nl Avoid using animal or human faeces or mud on a wound. These can \\ncause dangerous infections, such as tetanus.      \\nl Never put alcohol, tincture of iodine, or any medicine directly into a wound; doing so will damage the flesh and make healing slower.\\nl Avoid disturbing the scab (a dry covering over the wound) that has been formed.\\nl Visit a health facility if there is a deep/sharp cut for which stitches may be needed. \\n Refer persons to nearby health facility immediately in case the cut is large.\\n2. Care of the wound with bleeding: \\nMinor bleeding is readily controlled by pressure and elevation. In such cases \\na small ashesive dressing is all that is necessary.  Medical aid need only be \\nsought if the bleeding does not stop or if the wound is \\nat special risk of infection. \\nSteps to control severe external bleeding from wound: \\nl Raise the injured part\\nl Apply pressure on the wound directly by using  \\nyour fingers or palm preferably over a clean sterile \\ncloth/bandage. \\nl Hold the pressure. Don't keep checking to see if the \\nbleeding has stopped because this may damage or dislodge the clot that's forming and cause \\nbleeding to resume.\\nl If the bleeding is severe take patient to the hospital \\nimmediately and keep the pressure on.\"),\n",

About 46% of the \\nchildren below three years in India are underweight. This means that roughly \\none out of two children weigh less than they should for their age. Under \\nnutrition in early child hood is associated with poor academic performance, reduced work capacity, and poor health and nutrition status through childhood, \\nadolescence and adulthood.\\nFacts about malnutrition in young children\\nl  Malnutrition increases susceptibility to disease. Malnutrition is one of the \\ncontributory factors to over half of all child deaths.\\nl  Malnutrition is highly related to poverty. Poor families have less money to spend to get the quantity and variety of food, they find it more difficult to \\nget healthcare and also there is less time for child care.\\nl  Counselling can help the family in making the right choices on using their \\nscarce resources to feed their children and protect them from malnutrition.\\nl  Families are more comfortable when issues of feeding are discussed in their homes.

Most children look normal but their height and weight when measured \\nis less than expected for their age. It is therefore essential to weigh every child \\nmonthly, so as to detect malnutrition in time. Depending on the weight the \\nchild can be classified as mild, moderate or severely underweight.\\nSick children need special attention. However, families of all children especially \\nchildren below two should be counselled on feeding the child so as to prevent \\nmalnutrition.\\nSix important messages for preventing child malnutrition\\n1. Exclusive Breastfeeding\\nl  Till the age of six months, give only breast milk; not even water \\nshould be added.\\n2. Complementary Feeding\\nl  At the age of six months, add other foods. Breastfeeding alone is not enough, though it is good to continue breastfeeding for at least \\none to two years more. There are five things to remember about \\ncomplementary feeding:\\nl Consistency: Initially the food has to be so_ and mashed. But later, anything that adults eat can be given to the child, with less \\nspices. Do not dilute food. Keep it as thick as possible, for e.g. \\n‘give daal not daal ka pani’ .\\nl Quantity: Gradually increase the amount of such foods. Till at about one year, the child gets almost half as much nutrition as \\nthe mother.\\nl Frequency: The amount of complementary foods given \\nshould be equal to about half what the adult needs in terms of \\nnutrients. But since the child’s stomach is small, this amount has \\nto be distributed into four to five, even six feeds per day.\\nl Density: The food also has to be energy dense, low in volume, high in energy, therefore, add some oil or fats to the food. Family \\ncould add a spoon of it to every roti/every meal. Whatever \\nedible oil is available in the house is sufficient.\\nl Variety: Add protective foods – green leafy vegetables. The rule is that the greener it is, or the more red it is the more its \\nprotective quality. Similarly meat, eggs, fish are liked by children \\nand very nutritive and protective.\\n3. Feeding during the illness\\nl  Give as much as the child will take; do not reduce the quantity of food. After the illness, to catch up with growth, add an extra-feed. Recurrent illness is a \\nmajor cause of malnutrition.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'asha.pdf', 'page': 81}, page_content='81 Induction Training Module for ASHAs 4. Prevent illness\\nl  Recurrent illness is a major cause of malnutrition. There are six important \\nthings to remember which could prevent illness:\\nl Hand washing: before feeding the child, before preparing the child’s food, and after cleaning up the child who has passed stools. This is the \\nsingle most useful measure to prevent recurrent diarrhoea. \\nl Drinking water to be boiled. Though useful for everyone, it is of \\nparticular importance to the malnourished child with recurrent diarrhoea.\\nl Full immunisation of the child: Tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis and measles are all prevented by immunisation and are the diseases that \\ncause severe malnutrition. In malnourished children, these diseases are \\nmore common and life threatening, than in normal children.\\nl Vitamin A: To be given along with measles vaccine in the ninth month and then repeated once every six months till five years of age. This too \\nreduces infections and night blindness, all of which is more common in \\nmalnourished children. \\nl Avoid persons with infections, especially with a cough and cold picking up the child, and handling the child, or even coming near the child during \\nthe illness. This does not apply to mother, but even she should be more \\nrigorous in hand washing and more careful in handling the baby. \\nl Preventing Malaria: In districts with malaria the baby should sleep under an insecticide treated bed net. Malaria too is a major cause of \\nmalnutrition. You should encourage parents and other family members \\nto spend time with the child as it matters a lot. Time has to be spent in feeding the child. Time has to be spent in playing and talking with the \\nchild. Such children eat and absorb food better.\\n5. Access to health services\\nl Access to health services makes for prompt treatment of illness. On the \\nvery first day of the illness, if you help the mother decide on whether it is a \\nminor illness for which home remedy would be adequate, or to be referred \\nto a doctor, such a decision would save lives. Early treatment would prevent malnutrition.\\nl Access to contraceptive services is important. If the age of mother is less than 19, or the gap between two children is less than three years, there is a \\nmuch higher chance of the children being malnourished.\\n6. Access to anganwadi services\\nl The anganwadi provides a food supplement for the child up to the age \\nof 5. This could be a cooked meal, or in the form of take – home rations.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'asha.pdf', 'page': 82}, page_content='Induction Training Module for ASHAs \\n 82Malnourished children are to be given additional food supplements. For \\nchildren below the age of two, take – home rations are to be given. Even \\npregnant women and lactating mothers up to six months are entitled to \\nget food supplements in the anganwadi centres. _ Weighing the baby \\nand informing the family of the level of malnutrition is another important \\nanganwadi service. \\nl The anganwadi is also the site where the Village Health and Nutrition Day \\n(VHND) is conducted. The ANM visits every month and the child is given \\nimmunisation, Vitamin A, paediatric iron tablets, Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) \\npackets or drugs needed for illness management.\\nNote\\nWasted expenditure on unnecessary services is also an issue. Families \\ntend to spend a lot of money in commercial health foods which are very \\ncostly. This money is better spent in buying cheap, lower cost locally \\navailable nutritious foods. Tonics and health drinks are also a waste for the poor family. Unnecessary and costly treatments by local doctors \\nfor the recurrent bouts of diarrhoea and minor colds and coughs could \\nalso be a drain. One of the important services that you can perform is in making people aware that such expenditures are unnecessary.\\nCounselling on Malnutrition\\nAll the above messages are important for managing malnutrition also. But there are too many points to list out and the family members may not register it. Also, \\nmany of the messages may not be applicable to that particular child, or may not \\nbe possible for that family. For these reasons, we have to do it in two steps; first an analysis of why a child is malnourished and once we have an understanding \\nof this, then a dialogue with the family to see what can be done.\\nFor an analysis, we need to know the following\\nl  What is the nutritional status of child – is it normal, underweight, \\nmoderately underweight or severely underweight?\\nl  What is the child being fed as compared to what needs to be given?\\nl  What is the recent history of child’s illness, and whether enough has been done to treat it promptly and to prevent further illness?\\nl  What is the family’s access to the three key services?

Such problems if not recognised and managed \\ntimely may lead to serious consequences such as alcohol/drug abuse, juvenile delinquency etc. Family environment and peer influence are the two most important factors influencing the behaviour of the adolescence\\nRole of ASHA in addressing behavioural challenges\\nl  Build awareness and enable access to the Adolescent Friendly Health Services available in your area by letting parents and adolescents know that \\nthese centres have counsellors which interact with adolescents at the times of crisis or concern and help them in sorting a way out of their problems. \\nl  Counsel parents to be sensitive to these changes and adopt a strategy of parental supervision with good rapport building to avoid and solve such \\nissues. They need to recognise and address the signs of anxiety in their \\nchildren.\\nConcepts of sexuality are laid during this phase and it is important that \\nthe adolescents have access to the correct and complete information \\nrelated to this. This information is provided by the trained counsellors at \\nthe AFHS Centres based in the District Hospital/CHC.

Though RTIs can occur both in men and women, \\nthey are more common in women, because their body structure and functions \\nmake it easier for germs to enter. RTIs that spread through sexual contact are called Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs).Women are more vulnerable to these \\ninfections due to biological factors. Unequal power relations in matters of sex i.e. \\nsexual violence, non-use of condoms by men also expose women to risk..\\nWhy are these Diseases not Addressed? \\nWomen are usually shy and unwilling to talk about problems such as abnormal vaginal discharge and genital ulcers. There is a reluctance to seek medical \\ntreatment because of inadequate sex education and less access to medical care. \\nThe ‘decision-makers’ at home, \\nlike the mother-in-law, would allow a woman \\nto be taken to a health worker if she suffers from pregnancy-related problems \\nor infertility, but not for seemingly ‘trivial’ symptoms like excessive vaginal \\ndischarge. Even our health system does not adequately respond to these needs.\\nMode of Spread of RTI and STI\\nYou need to know not all the reproductive tract infections are sexually \\ntransmitted but all the sexually transmitted infections are reproductive tract \\ninfections. Those which are sexually spread are commonly observed in cases \\nwhen individuals indulge in casual sex usually with infected individuals or have sex with multiple partners.\\nIn women these infections are due to:\\nl  Trauma during delivery\\nl  Use of unclean instruments during childbirth or during abortions\\nReproductive Tract Infections and \\nSexually Transmitted InfectionsSection 12'),\n",

It is about a miracle that ordinary \\nwomen were able to achieve collectively. It is about a community of hard-working \\nwomen who laboured in the fields to earn their living. The menfolk of this village were so addicted to liquor that they not only spent money on it, but also sold the \\nhard earned food materials, pulses, chillies, rice, butter and ghee (clarified butter), in \\nexchange for liquor. At times, when their earnings were not enough, they incurred debts or stole household articles like glasses, plates or even their wives’ saris. After \\ndrinking arrack they would use foul language, beat their wives and children making \\ntheir lives miserable. The women felt extremely helpless. There were two liquor shops in the locality. The village men used to go straight to these shops in the evening \\nafter returning from work. They came home late at night, completely drunk They \\nwould hand over some money for household expenses only if there was any left. The situation reached a climax when one man, in an intoxicated condition, stabbed his \\nfather to death. Apart from this incident, Vijayamma, a woman of this community \\nalso had an alcoholic husband, when her relatives visited her house they were scared away from the village by the obscene language of her closest neighbour, \\na heavy drinker. She felt ashamed and thought that the village would be a much \\nbetter place without arrack.\\nEveryday while working in the fields and at the community wells the women \\ndiscussed the arrack menace. One day the women joined together and approached \\nthe village president (Sarpanch) and the village elders. They expressed their problem and asked them to get remove the arrack and toddy shops. The elders and the \\nSarpanch, although agreeable, were unable to do anything. The next day one \\nhundred women gathered together. They went to the outskirts of the village and stopped a toddy-cart.‘You cannot come into the village’ , they told the cart driver \\nstrongly in unison and stood in front of it. ‘Throw all the toddy away.’ Each of them \\noffered him a rupee to do so. The driver got scared and left the village.\\nThen a jeep with arrack packs arrived. The women surrounded it and demanded \\nthat it returned without unloading the arrack. After two days the police came to the \\nvillage and said that all those who bid at auctions had the right to sell arrack. The women stood unmoved. They said that they would go to the Collector and would \\nnot keep quiet if arrack was sold in their village. The arrack contractors got cold feet.  Annexure 4: Anti Arrack Movement'),\n",
